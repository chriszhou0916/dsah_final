### TODO list
1. visualize distribution of hospital length of stays in a histogram, grouped by death
2. Extract 20 patients, 10 control, 10 dead, from all tables
  - All patients should have length of stay > 6 days
- Window them by 48 hours
  - every 48 hours pretend it's a new patient, but with same patient_id
- Try different features for each table after we subdivide the patients
